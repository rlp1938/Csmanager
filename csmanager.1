.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] \- helps with managing files in cloud storage.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] [\f[B]\-h\f[]] [\f[B]\-\-help\f[]]
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] [\f[I]option\f[]] [\f[I]source_dir\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] hard links files from the user selected
\f[I]source_dir\f[] into the \f[I]target dir\f[] that is synchronised
with cloud storage.
Normally the \f[I]target dir\f[] would be named \f[I]Dropbox\f[] or
\f[I]Nextcloud\f[].
The program creates required sub\-dirs under the target dir as required.
The actual link management is performed by the program \f[B]synclink\f[]
which must be downloaded and installed as well as \f[B]csmanager\f[].
.PP
Normally the \f[I]source_dir\f[] would be \f[B]$HOME\f[] but the user
may optionally select a file listing specific dirs to be synced to
cloud.
This is especially useful for users who want to take advantage of free
storage offers of low volume.

.B \f[B]\-f, \-\-dot\-files\-dir\f[]
Only normal dirs are directly synced into the \f[I]cloud_dir\f[].
Hidden dirs are synced into a sub\-dir of the \f[I]cloud_dir\f[].
By default this sub\-dir is named \f[I]Dotty\f[].
You may change the name of this sub\-dir with this option.

.B \f[B]\-c, \-\-cloud\-target\f[] \f[I]target_dir\f[]
The default target directory name is \f[I]Nextcloud\f[] but if you need
to use \f[I]Dropbox\f[] you can use this option to chose it, or any
other target directory name.

.TP
.B \f[B]\-d, \-\-dirs\-from\f[] \f[I]filename\f[]
A file containing a list of dirs to be synced.
Usually the program will be run using a directory as the source but it
is possible to simply name a list of dirs to be linked onto the target
dir.
In this use the other options have no meaning.
This option may be useful when using any free low volume space on offer
from some \f[B]nextcloud\f[] servers.

.SH FILES
