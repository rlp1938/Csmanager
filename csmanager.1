.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] \- helps with managing files in cloud storage.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] [\f[B]\-h\f[]] [\f[B]\-\-help\f[]]
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] [\f[I]option\f[]] \f[I]source_dir\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]csmanager\f[] hard links files from the user selected source_dir
into the target dir that is synchronised with cloud storage.
Normally the target dir would be named \f[I]Dropbox\f[] or
\f[I]Nextcloud\f[].
The program creates required sub\-dirs under the target dir as required.
The actual link management is performed by the program \f[B]synclink\f[]
which must be downloaded and installed as well as \f[B]csmanager\f[].
.PP
Normally the \f[I]source_dir\f[] would be \f[B]$HOME\f[] but the user
may optionally select a file listing specific dirs to be synced to
cloud.
This is especially useful for users who want to take advantage of free
storage offers of low volume.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \f[B]\-D, \-\-dot\-dirs\f[]
When run without options the program operates only on subdirs of the
user input \f[I]source_dir\f[] which are not hidden, ie do not start
with \[aq].\[aq] but when run with this option it links these hidden
dirs into \f[I]source_dir\f[]/\f[B]dotty\f[].
The intention here is to avoid any clash on the server with any dir
names that have some meaning thereto.

.B \f[B]\-t, \-\-target\f[] \f[I]target_dir\f[]
The default target directory name is \f[B]Nextcloud\f[] but if you need
to use \f[B]Dropbox\f[] you can use this option to chose it, or any
other target directory name.

.B \f[B]\-f, \-\-files\-from\f[] \f[I]filename\f[]
Usually the program will be run using a directory as the source but it
is possible to simply name a list of dirs and files to be linked onto
the target dir.
In this use the \f[B]\-t\f[] and \f[B]\-D\f[] options have no meaning.
This option may be useful when using any free low volume space on offer
from some \f[B]nextcloud\f[] servers.
